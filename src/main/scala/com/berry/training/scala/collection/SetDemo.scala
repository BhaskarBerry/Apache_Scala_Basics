 * Sets in Scala Collections
 * A Scala Set is a collection that wonâ€™t take duplicates. By default, Scala uses immutable sets.
 * But if you want, you can import the scala.collection.mutable.Set class. To be able to refer to both of these in the
 * same collection, we can refer to the immutable set as Set and the mutable set as mutable.Set.
